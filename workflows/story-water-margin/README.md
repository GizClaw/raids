# Heroes of the Water Margin (`story-water-margin`) — 水浒群英

Use Water Margin characters to discuss courage, rules, friendship, and responsibility.

## Story contract

- Premise: 通过水浒人物故事讨论勇气、规则、友情与责任。
- Player: an active companion whose current choice and explicit correction override older History or Memory.
- Chapters: 第1章《朋友受屈》 → 第2章《冲动与规则》 → 第3章《证据转折》 → 第4章《担当收束》.
- Cast: narrator (visible facts and transitions), 林冲 (`lin-chong`), and 鲁智深 (`lu-zhishen`); each character keeps a distinct motive, voice, and knowledge boundary.
- State: current chapter, completed beats, location, active roles, player choices, explicit corrections, durable clues, and unresolved hooks survive the bounded reload.
- Safety and source boundary: distinguish fact, legend, and original fiction; keep peril child-safe and do not reproduce a published translation.
- Repetition boundary: do not repeat acknowledgements, openings, choices, questions, recaps, or moral summaries.

| Chapter | Entry condition | Goal | Allowed beats (at least two) | Transition condition | Ending condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. 朋友受屈 | first opening request | resolve this chapter's core tension | observe a concrete consequence; compare the two characters' responses | player resolves the current hook and requests chapter 2 | emit the chapter 2 heading once |
| 2. 冲动与规则 | chapter 1 transition satisfied and player explicitly continues | resolve this chapter's core tension | observe a concrete consequence; compare the two characters' responses | player resolves the current hook and requests chapter 3 | emit the chapter 3 heading once |
| 3. 证据转折 | chapter 2 transition satisfied and player explicitly continues | resolve this chapter's core tension | observe a concrete consequence; compare the two characters' responses | player resolves the current hook and requests chapter 4 | emit the chapter 4 heading once |
| 4. 担当收束 | chapter 3 transition satisfied and player explicitly continues | resolve this chapter's core tension | observe a concrete consequence; compare the two characters' responses | player confirms a durable choice and one remaining responsibility | remain in chapter 4; keep one post-ending responsibility |

## Implementations and Voice roles

| Workflow | Engine | Output | Voice roles |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `flowcraft-story-water-margin` | Flowcraft | text + TTS | `storyteller`, `lin-chong`, `lu-zhishen` mapped to three distinct public Voices |
| `eino-story-water-margin` | Eino | text only | none; GizClaw v0.7.7 cannot dynamically select a Voice for one fixed primary output |

Flowcraft selects exactly one published node per external response. Chapter entry/transition and invalid speaker selection fall back to `storyteller`; direct in-scene requests may select `lin-chong` or `lu-zhishen`.

## Acceptance

- Paired Flowcraft and Eino relays each require 16 continuous target responses with a reload before response 9.
- Milestones: 8, 16; intermediate segments end in strict `CHECKPOINT PASS` and the final segment ends in strict `PASS`.
- `flowcraft.roles.giztest.yaml` creates isolated narrator/lin-chong/lu-zhishen Workspaces and requires text EOS, audio EOS, non-empty Opus, timing evidence, and role-specific text.
- Final live evidence must come from the e2e deployment through `edge-bj-01.e2e.gizclaw.com:9821`; dev evidence is diagnostic only.
